# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol
# Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

# Algorithm:

# Step 1: 
Users deposit ETH into the smart contract to earn interest over time.

# Step 2:
 Users can borrow ETH by providing enough collateral (at least 150% of the borrowed amount).

# Step 3:
 The contract checks that collateral is sufficient before allowing the loan.

# Step 4: 
Interest is calculated dynamically based on how much ETH is borrowed compared to total deposits.

# Step 5:
 If a borrowerâ€™s collateral value drops below the safe level (liquidation threshold), they can be liquidated.

# Step 6:
 Liquidators can repay a borrower's debt and claim their collateral to maintain system stability.
